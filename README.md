# billing-record-management
The project reduces Azure Cosmos DB costs by archiving billing records older than 3 months to cheaper Azure Blob Storage tiers. A seamless access layer fetches data from Cosmos or Blob without API changes. Azure Functions automate archival, ensuring data availability, cost efficiency, and scalability in a serverless Azure setup.
